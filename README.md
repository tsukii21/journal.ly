# journal.ly
A simple react journal site.

## Setting up
 - Make sure you have node and mongodb installed and the mongo server is running on its default port 27017
 - After cloning, go to the folder and run
 ```
 npm install
 ```
 - Then go to /backend and run again
 ```
 npm install
 ```
 This will install the dependencies of the frontend and the backend
 - Then in the main folder run
 ```
 npm run dev
 ```
 This will start the backend server at port 5000 and the frontend server at port 3000 simultaneously.

 - Now the site can be accessed at localhost:3000
 
 ## local password feature
 When launched, the site will ask for a password. <br />
 The default password is **React21**. <br />
 This can be changed in the code
